Sets To Do 5


Heap: Extract
Create a MinHeap method that removes the heap’s minimum value and returns it.



Heap: Heapify Array
Create a heap method that accepts an array as its own, and turns it into a rule-abiding MinHeap.



Heap Sort
Lance discovers with glee that if one heapifies an unsorted array, then extracts values, the array is sorted in O(NlogN) time – as fast as quick sort or merge sort, the usual winners in generalized sorting! He views this as solid proof that the Heap truly is “the crown prince of data structures.” Write a standalone function heapSort(arr) that accepts an unsorted array and uses a heap to sort it.

Second: do this in-place without creating a second array.
