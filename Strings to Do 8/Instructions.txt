String to Word Array
Given a string of words (with spaces, tabs, and linefeeds), returns an array of words. 

Given "Life is not a drill!" return ["Life", "is" "not", "a", "drill!"].

Bonus: handle punctuation.



Reverse Word Order
Create a function that, given a string of words (with spaces), returns new string with words in reverse sequence. 

Given "This is a test", return "test a is This".

Bonus: handle punctuation and capitalization. Example: given "Life is not a drill, go for it!" you should return "It for go, drill a not is life!"




Longest Word
Create a function that, given a string of words, returns the longest word. Example: given "Snap crackle pop makes the world go round!", return "crackle". Bonus: handle punctuation.



Unique Words
Given a string, retain words that occur only once. Given "Sing! Sing a song; sing out loud; sing out strong.", return "Sing! Sing a song; loud; strong". Punctuation is part of the word: "Sing!" is not "Sing". 

Bonus: ignore punctuation and capitalization. Ex.: given "Sing a song! Sing a song; sing out loud and strong.", return "out loud and strong".
