Trie Map
We can expand a TrieSet to a trieMap by associating an additional value to each stored string.



Trie Map: Insert
Insert should accept a key and a value and should return the preexisting value (if the key already existed) or null if the key is new. 



Trie Map: Contains
Contains should return the value for the given key (null if the key is not found).



Trie Map: Remove
Remove deletes the given key (and value),  returning true if the key was found, else false.



Trie Map: Size
Size is unchanged from TrieSet.



Trie Map: First
First returns an object containing the key-value pair for the alphabetically-lowest key.



Trie Map: Last
Conversely, Last returns the final key-value.



Trie Map: Next
Given a key that may not be present, next(key) returns the subsequent key-value.
