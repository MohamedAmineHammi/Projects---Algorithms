Recursion To Do 4


Recursive List Length
Given the first node of a singly linked list, create a recursive function that returns the number of nodes in that list. Assume list contains no loops and is short enough that you will not ‘blow your stack’.



Got Any Grapes?!?
Martin loves grapes. He sees a number of baggies containing grapes, all in a row. Stephen tells him that he can take as many of the baggies as he wants, as long as he doesn’t take two that are next to each other. Martin wants to maximize his number of grapes. Grapes are pretty healthy, so let’s help him out. Create a function to accept an array of non-negative integers representing the number of grapes in each adjacent baggy. Your function should return the maximum number of grapes he can obtain.



Collatz-apalooza
Define a function that, given positive integer num, returns num/2 if num is even or 3*num + 1 if num is odd. Continuously feeding the result back into function results in numerical series such as 5,16,8,4,2,1. According to Dr. Lothar Collatz, the series always reaches 1 (and then repeats 4,2,1,4,2,1,…). What starting number requires the most iterations before reaching 1 the first time?



Telephone Words
Nikki has a new phone number (304-5083) and wants to create a clever way for everyone to remember it. On older telephones, the keypad associates letters with each numeral. Given a seven-digit telephone number, return an array of all possible strings that equate to that phone number. For reference, here is the mapping: [2:ABC; 3:DEF; 4:GHI; 5:JKL; 6:MNO; 7:PQRS; 8:TUV; 9:WXYZ] – for completeness, map 1 to I and zero to O. 

For example, given a phone number 818-2612, return an array of 243 different strings, including “vitamic” and “titania”.
