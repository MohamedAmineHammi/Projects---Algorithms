Interleave Arrays
Given two unsorted arrays, create a new array containing the elements of both, resulting in an unsorted merge of all values. When populating the new array alternate (interleave) values between the two arrays until one is exhausted, then include all of the other. 

Example: given [77,22,11,22] and [2,6,7,2,6,2], return [77,2,22,6,11,7,22,2,6,2].



Merge Sorted Arrays
Efficiently merge two already-sorted arrays into a new sorted array containing the multiset of all values. Example: given [1,2,2,2,7] and [2,2,6,6,7], return new array [1,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,7,7].

Example: given [1,2,2,2,7] y [2,2,6,6,7], devuelve una nueva matriz [1,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,7,7 ].



Minimal Three-Array Range
Given three separately-sorted arrays, determine the value from each array that creates the smallest range, and returns the min and max of that range. All three of the arrays must have a value within the range. Example: given ([1,2,4,15],[3,10,12],[5,10,13,17,23]), return {min:3,max:5}.
