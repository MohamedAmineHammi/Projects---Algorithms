DList Class
Given the above reference implementations for doubly linked node and doubly linked list, can you construct the rest of a basic DList class? This would include DList methods push(), pop(), front(), back(), contains(), and size().
Second: implement these so that they are available as standalone functions as well as methods on both DLNode and DList classes.
