Strings To Do 10
This chapter we revisit strings, having mastered the fine art of recursion. Remember: recursion is not an answer to every problem; everything that can be solved with recursion can also be solved without.




String: Dedupe
Remove duplicate characters (case-sensitive) including punctuation. Keep only the last instance of each character. Given "Snaps! crackles! pops!", return "Snrackle ops!".



Index of First Unique Letter
Return the index of the first unique (case-sensitive) character in a given string. Ex.: "empathetic monarch meets primo stinker" should return 35 (str[35] is "k").



Unique Letters
Return only the unique characters from a given string. Specifically, omit all instances of a (case-sensitive) character if it appears more than once, respecting spaces and punctuation. Given "Snap! Crackle! Poop!", return "SnCrcklePp".



Num to String
Create a function that converts a number into a string containing those exact numerals. For example, given 1234, return the string "1234". No, you may not use the toString() function.

Second: include fractional values as well. Given 11.2051, return "11.2051".

 

Num to Text
Convert an integer into the English text for the number. Given 40213, return "forty thousand two hundred thirteen".

Second: include 4 fractional digits. Given 11.2051, return "eleven point two zero five one".
