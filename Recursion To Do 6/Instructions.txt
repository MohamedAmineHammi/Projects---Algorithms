Recursion To Do 6


Sum of Squares
Mike enjoys teaching the “lego concept” to beginning HTML/CSS students: breaking a web page into different rectangles. There is something about squares that appeals to his sense of balance. Given an integer, calculate and print all combinations of square integers that sum to that integer. No duplicates are allowed among smaller integers. sumOfSquares(10) => “1 + 9”.  sumOfSquares(30) => “1 + 4 + 25, 1 + 4 + 9 + 16”. Solve recursively with no loops.



All Valid N Pairs of Parens
Given the number of pairs of parentheses, return an array of strings, where each string represents a different valid way to order those parentheses. Example: given 2, return ["()()", "(())"].



Towers of Hanoi
Create an algorithm to solve the Towers of Hanoi game. In the Towers of Hanoi, there are three poles and a stack of disks that fit onto the poles. The disks range from largest (on bottom) to smallest (on top), currently, all on pole A. Moving only one disk at a time, move the stack to pole C. You can use any of the three poles you wish. A larger disk can never be placed on top of a smaller disk. How many moves does it take to relocate six disks from pole A to pole C? What is the first move?



IP Addresses
Given a string containing digits, add three decimal points to convert into a valid IP address and return that string. Each of the four quads in a "###.###.###.###" IP address is a number between 0 and 255. Given "255255255", you could return "2.55.255.255", or "25.5.255.255", or others. 

Second: return an array of all possible valid IP address combinations, for the given string.



Uneven Digits
Cami doesn’t know why, but she’s just in an odd mood today. Let’s make all numerals odd for her. Given an integer, recursively return the integer formed by stripping out all even digits in original. 

Solve without loops. uneven(-1845) = -15; uneven(79) = 79; uneven(20) = 0; uneven(-92) = -9.



Generate All Possible Coin Change
Create generateAllCoinChange(cents). Given a number of American cents, compute and return an array enumerating all possible ways to represent it, with pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), quarters (25 cents). For 5, return  [{dimes:0,nickels:1,pennies:0,quarters:0}, {dimes:0,nickels:0,pennies:5,quarters:0}{}]. Do not return duplicate results.
