Arrays To Do 9


Median of Sorted Arrays
Given two arrays that are sorted but not necessarily the same length, find the median value. Given ([1,5,9], [1,2,3,4,5,6]), return 4. If the number of values is even, return the average of the two middle values. Given ([1,5,9], [1,2,3,4,5]), return 3.5.

Second: accept three arrays instead of two.



Time to English
You are given an integer representing the number of minutes that have elapsed since midnight. You should return a string  representing the current time, in the traditional spoken convention. Use numerals, except specifically the following words â€“ midnight, noon, past, til, half, quarter. Examples: if given 30, return "half past midnight". If given 75, return "quarter past 1 am". If given 710, return "10 til noon". If given 1000, return "20 til 5 pm".



Missing Value
You are given an array of length N that contains, in no particular order, integers from 0 to N. One integer value is missing. Quickly determine and return the missing value. Given ([3,0,1]), return 2.

Second: now the lowest value can now be any integer (including negatives), instead of always being 0. Given ([2,-4,0,-3,-2,1]) return -1. Given ([5,2,7,8,4,9,3]), return 6.
